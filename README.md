# Colony Counter
This repository hosts a Python script utilizing OpenCV to automatically count bacterial colonies in petri dishes. The script employs various image processing techniques to isolate and enumerate colonies efficiently and accurately.

## Features
- **Image Selection**: Use a file browser to select an image of a petri dish.
- **Grid Overlay**: Apply a reference grid to the image, aiding in manual adjustments.
- **ROI Selection**: Manually select regions of petri dish.
- **Image Cropping**: Isolate the selected ROI.
- **Contrast Enhancement**: Use blackhat morphological transformations to improve visibility of colonies against the medium.
- **Binary Thresholding**: Simplify the image to binary form.
- **Watershed Algorithm**: Segment the image to distinguish individual colonies.
- **Counting and Visualization**: Calculate and display the number of colonies(print in terminal), highlighting each detected colony.

## Prerequisites
Ensure these prerequisites are installed on your system:

- Python 3.x: Python 3.6 or higher is recommended. I am developing with Python 3.9.5.
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Tkinter
Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## Usage
demonstrateï¼šhttps://youtu.be/0kkqQw8T_aM

1.Download the script or clone this repository.

2.Run the script:

```bash
python colony_counter.py
```
3.Adjust the parameter **threshold_percentage**. The higher the threshold_percentagem, the stronger the ability to isolate colonies, but the easier it is to ignore details.(Large colonies are suitable for high values, and small colonies are suitable for high values.)
You can find threshold_percentage in below function.
```python=
def prepare_for_watershed(image):
    sure_bg = cv2.dilate(image, np.ones((3,3), np.uint8), iterations=3)
    
    dist_transform = cv2.distanceTransform(image, cv2.DIST_L2, 5) 

    threshold_percentage = 0.3
    _, sure_fg = cv2.threshold(dist_transform, threshold_percentage * dist_transform.max(), 255, 0)
    
    sure_fg = np.uint8(sure_fg)
    unknown = cv2.subtract(sure_bg, sure_fg)

    cv2.imshow('test', sure_fg)

    return sure_fg, unknown
```

4.Follow the GUI prompts to select an image and proceed through the steps of processing and counting the colonies.(Press enter to next picture / The number of colonies will print in terminal.)
